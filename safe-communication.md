# Safe Communication

Subversion is risky.

Subversion is dangerous.

In some countries and some situations, subversion will get you fined, arrested, sentenced, imprisoned, maybe even capital'd[^1].



So how to evade such effects?



Two necessary aspects:

Problem 1:&#x20;

Getting blocked, banned, shadowbanned, and otherwise silenced by algorithms and social media corporations.

Solution:

Decentralized communications.



Problem 2:

Discussing illegal activities, activism, etc., online is risky and can lead to imprisonment or worse.

Solution:

Anonimized communications.

[^1]: If you don't know this, duckduckgo _"capital punishment"_
