# Subversion

{% hint style="danger" %}
Saving the planet is bad for business.
{% endhint %}



We know already that nobody is coming to save us

The governments are not going to save us

The corporations are not going to save us

The billionaires are not going to save us

The billionaires who pretend to be heroes are consistently liars or failures

Or they "fall from grace"

Even the spokespeople who appear from the dust, soon their time comes when either they sell out or they get silenced or disappeared



We can only succeed in guarding the planet, as a global, interlocked force of good humans co‑operating.

Saving the planet is bad for business.

The governments and billionaires and corporations will continue try to foil our every attempt.

As far as business and œconomics go, saving the planet is illegal.

Greenwashing exists; that is not new news.



{% hint style="success" %}
To be effective, we _must_ be **subversive**.
{% endhint %}



If you think about it, there is really no other choice.
